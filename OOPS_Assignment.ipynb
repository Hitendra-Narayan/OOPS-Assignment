        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "Classes and Objects:\n",
        "A class is like a blueprint, and an object is an instance of that class. Think of a class as a cookie cutter and an object as the actual cookie.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "It means bundling the data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into one unit (the object), and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "It's like a capsule that protects what's inside from the outside world.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance:\n",
        "Inheritance allows one class (child class) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (parent class).\n",
        "It's like children inheriting traits from their parents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism:\n",
        "Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object they're called on.\n",
        "It's like one word having different meanings depending on context (e.g., \"run\" can mean running a race or running a program).\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction:\n",
        "Abstraction hides complex details and shows only the essential features.\n",
        "It's like using a remote control—you don't need to know how it works internally, just how to press the buttons to get the TV working."
